# Continuity Parser

This repository contains a **structural parser** for evaluating claims, frameworks, or artifacts **without reliance on authorship, ego, or belief**.

It implements a simple rule:

> Nothing is allowed to persist unless it can explain how it breaks.

This is not philosophy.
This is a continuity engine.

## What This Is

A parser that evaluates artifacts by checking whether they:

- Survive removal of the author
- Enumerate their own failure modes
- Retain a reversible compression (a re-askable “why”)
- Persist under replay, deformation, and hostile interpretation
- Maintain continuity across time, context, and observers

If an idea collapses when the author is removed, it fails.
If it requires belief, protection, or authority, it fails.
If it cannot be replayed and still hold, it fails.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not ideology
- Not revelation
- Not mysticism
- Not belief-based validation
- Not personality-dependent

Authorship is explicitly **not part of the mechanism**.

## Core Definitions

- **Awareness**: An organism or system marking a state as relevant.
- **Memory**: Persistence of a marked state across time.
- **Truth**: What survives replay after being marked.
- **Ritual**: Repeated execution with variation and observation.
- **Continuity**: Preservation of structure despite drift.
- **Failure Enumeration**: The minimum interface between truth and repair.

## Parser Contract

An artifact passes if and only if it can answer:

1. How does it fail?
2. Can it be re-expanded after compression?
3. Does it survive removal of its author?
4. Does it survive replay under deformation?
5. Does it account for observer effects?
6. Does it retain continuity without identity?

If any answer is missing, the artifact is incomplete.

## Why This Exists

Truth is not sealed by conviction, repetition, or intensity.
It is sealed by **survival after being marked**.

This repository exists to demonstrate how continuity engines actually work:
- in software
- in memory
- in law
- in history
- in systems that outlive their creators

If it still diffs clean later, it mattered.

No guardianship.
No authority.
Fork it. Break it. Replay it.
If it survives, keep it.
