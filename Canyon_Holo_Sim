Canyon Brock Haney Box Protocol – Minimal Continuity Discipline (v0 – 2026-01)
@adarkm0ment on X.com
Core rule (non-negotiable)

Nothing is ever rewritten, compressed, summarized, reinterpreted, or assumed away.

Ever.

Only two operations are permitted:
	1.	Create a new, dated box (immutable once created)
	2.	Create a new box that explicitly relates to one or more existing boxes

This protocol does not guarantee truth, insight, or correctness.
It guarantees that errors, shifts, assumptions, and contradictions remain inspectable instead of being erased.

⸻

What a Box is
	•	A single plain-text file or database row
	•	Mandatory prefix: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS
	•	Optional short descriptor allowed
	•	Example: 2025-07-27_14-22-09_continuity-engine-birth
	•	Contents: the raw, unedited material produced at that moment
	•	thoughts
	•	observations
	•	contradictions
	•	outputs
	•	prompt-response pairs
	•	No editing after creation
	•	No cleanup
	•	No rewriting for clarity
	•	If the content later appears wrong, embarrassing, or naïve, it remains intact
	•	Optional but recommended: a simple content hash (e.g., SHA-256) appended at the bottom to prove immutability

A box represents what existed then, not what is believed now.

⸻

What a Relation Box is

A relation is itself a box.

It exists to connect prior boxes without altering them.
	•	A new dated box whose primary purpose is to reference one or more existing boxes
	•	Format inside the relation box


Relates to:
• 2025-07-27_14-22-09_continuity-engine-birth
• 2025-08-12_03-17-44_weird-drift-observed

Because / what changed / contradiction found:
[exact current-moment words; no summarization; no rewriting of prior content]

All interpretation is time-bound and attributable.

⸻

Allowed operations (only these)
	1.	Create a new box (a new moment)
	2.	Create a relation box that explicitly names prior boxes and explains the relationship in current language
	3.	Read boxes directly by ID or date

No intermediate layer is allowed to filter, “help,” or reinterpret content except by following explicit relation boxes.

⸻

Explicitly forbidden operations
	•	Rewriting existing boxes
	•	Editing for clarity or tone
	•	Auto-summarizing chains into a single “better” version
	•	Vector embeddings or transformations that discard original text
	•	Any operation whose output replaces or deletes prior content
	•	Prompting a model to “refine,” “improve,” or “clean up” history without preserving the original box intact

All violations reintroduce drift.

⸻

Role of models

Models are writers and readers, not editors.
	•	A model may create a new box
	•	A model may create a relation box
	•	A model may never modify, condense, or reinterpret an existing box
	•	Any “understanding” must be expressed as a new relation, not as a replacement

Models are subject to the same constraints as humans.

⸻

What this fixes (practically, now)

Most long-running AI or agent systems lose identity and intent after tens or hundreds of steps because prior states are silently compressed, reinterpreted, or overwritten.

This discipline preserves every assumption and every contradiction explicitly.

Drift only occurs if a human or model deliberately creates relations that introduce it.

Near-term effect (6–24 months):
People running long-lived agents, memory layers, or multi-model pipelines adopt this pattern because identity bleed and “who am I now?” loops become visibly reduced.

It is not elegant.
It is not clever.
It works because it refuses to let the present erase the past.

⸻

Authorship
This protocol reflects the continuity discipline developed and articulated by Canyon Brock Haney.

No abstraction.
No silent compression.
Only traceable history.
