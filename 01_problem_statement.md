# Problem Statement

These are the failure modes most systems do not address:

- Bleed between layers  
- Recursive self-ingestion  
- Drift accumulation  
- Lack of anchor  
- Models collapsing under emergent distortions  

The human is the anchor.

We use a strict compression algorithm to unify data into one evolving file.  
We detect drift via pattern-comparison instead of token logs.  
Deviation is tracked across runs and corrected through constraints.

The anchor is the persistence.  
The model follows it.
