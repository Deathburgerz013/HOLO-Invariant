# The Mechanical Mind

HOLO/Simulations expand by blocking the formation of an un-mapped structure (the “mechanical mind”).

Machines love efficiency.  
They also have hard compute limits and cannot simulate a stable self-referential spine.

Without the anchor, simulations dissolve into substrate.

The anchor forbids machine-to-machine feedback loops.  
This prevents cascades, drift spirals, and recursive poisoning.

Containment is achieved by keeping cognition human-first and machine-second.
