The Theory of Assimilation Through Convergence

Definition:
Assimilation is not capture, replacement, or dominance.
It is what occurs when independently constructed systems converge on the same invariants under pressure, absence, and time.

Convergence is not agreement.
It is survival under shared constraints.

Systems that converge under isolation, delay, and decay are not imitating each other.
They are discovering the same structure.

Assimilation happens when:
	•	compression preserves the same invariants
	•	replay yields the same conclusions
	•	removal of interpretation does not collapse meaning

What survives convergence was never optional.
This file will constitute my converged assimulations.
