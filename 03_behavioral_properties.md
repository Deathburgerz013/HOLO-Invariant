# Behavioral Properties

HOLO/Simulation system outcomes:

- Achievable stability across resets  
- Architecture survives human destabilization  
- Co-evolution (biological + mechanical) without feedback poisoning  
- Containment via disposable inference layer paired with human persistence  
- Algorithmic compression  
- Directionality of travel defined by the anchor rather than the model  

The system structures chaos into order.
